            <h2>Why the Cotswolds?</h2>
            <h3>The Cotswolds, the 'Heart of England'</h3>
            <p>
              Beauty, adventure, culture – the Cotswolds has it all. Famous for
              its lush rolling pastures, pretty stone villages and rambling
              rivers, this rural belle has graced countless books, artworks and
              TV shows – but does it live up to the hype? Absolutely.
            </p>
            <p>
              From the willow-shaded banks of the River Thames, and Blenheim
              Palace’s lavish décor, to the honey-coloured cottages of
              Bourton-on-the-Water, Chipping Campden and Burford – it’s all just
              as idyllic as you imagine. There are ancient castles to explore,
              wild lakes to kayak, local wines to taste, and endless trails to
              hike, cycle and ride.

                <h4>Berkeley Castle</h4>
                <p>
                  Is one of the best castles in England and parts of this
                  incredible building are over 800 years old. There are many
                  fascinating rooms to explore within the castle, such as the
                  cell and dungeon in which King Edward II was kept prisoner and
                  murdered. The impressive interior is not to be outdone by the
                  stunning gardens and the delightful Butterfly House.

                <p>
                  It is quirky with lots of information and artefacts. Lovely
                  gardens and right next door is St Mary's Church and the house
                  of Dr Jenner, who invented the vaccination process on people.

              Hi! My name is Viv and I've been living in the Cotswolds for
              several years. I love the area and created this website as a
              project, to demonstrate my ability to develop a responsive website
              without using Bootstrap.
